# MusiQ

## Inspiration
Make people closer together using the music as a connector.

## What it does
With the help of a QR reader you can subscribe to a local point where your music data will be loaded into the system, there, it will be merged with the other people's music playing something that everyone will like.

## How we built it
We have a flutter interface for android that we can use to subscribe to the locals and share our music taste. Behind that, there is a database where locals and users get registered stored in Firebase and accessed with Flask Framework. To find a common taste in music we have implemented a very simple K-Means algorithm. 

## Challenges we ran into
Learning new technologies from 0, understanding external API's, etc.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning new skills, gathered more knowledge.

## What we learned
A new framework, flask.
A new language flutter and a framework to create applications for smartphone Android and IOs.
To work with QR

## What's next for MusiQ
Change QRs for beacons to make more accessible and more comfortable improving the user experience.
